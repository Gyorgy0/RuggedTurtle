This is my first interpreter written in Rust. The program let's you control a turtle with specific commands. The program primarily is for teaching programming,
by visualizing instruction graphically.

Below you can see some examples that this program can produce, using some simple instructions:
# Graphics
### command: for(i, 0, 200) {pencolor(55+i, 0, 55+i, 255); forward(30+i); right(59)}

### command: for(i, 0, 200) {forward(100); right(59+i); forward(100)}
